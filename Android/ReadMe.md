## Usage

### JSON Configuration Examples
The following are possible JSON configurations that can be sent to the device using the following method 

```java
public void ConfigureDevice(String config);
``` 

#### RAW Configuration Request
```json
{
	"raw" : {
		"stream": true 
	}
}
```
#### RAW Configuration Response
> This response will be received multiple times until a RAW Configuration request to disable streaming is received or the device is disconnected.

```json
{
	"raw" : {
		"device" : "TAS1D12345678",
		"timestamp" : "1427113646",
		"acceleration" : [
			{
				"x" : 0.0003,
				"y" : 1.0002,
				"z" : 0.0001
			},
			{
				"x" : 0.0001,
				"y" : 0.0003,
				"z" : 1.0001
			} 
		]
	}
}
```

#### IMU Configuration Request
```json
{
	"imu" : {
		"accelerometer": false,
		"gyroscope": true,
		"magnetometer": false,
		"temperature": true
	}
}
```
#### IMU Configuration Response
> There is no response from the device upon successful configuration of IMU states.


#### Epoch Configuration Request
```json
{
	"epoch" : {
		"startDateTime": "07-21-2015 04:05:00",
		"stopDateTime": "07-21-2015 04:06:00"
	}
}
```
#### Epoch Configuration Response
> After requesting to download epoch information from the device, there will be progress updates of the download followed by a final response which will have all the epoch information provided.

```json

{ 
	"epochDownload" : {
		"state" : "started",
		"progress" : 0 
	} 
}

{ 
	"epochDownload" : {
		"state" : "downloading",
		"progress" : 55 
	} 
}

{ 
	"epochDownload" : {
		"state" : "completed",
		"progress" : 100 
	} 
}

{
	"epoch" : {
		"startdatetime" : "07-21-2015 04:05:00",
		"stopdatetime" : "07-21-2015 04:06:00",
		"epochData" : [{
			"timestamp": "07-07-2015 04:05:00",
			"xCounts": 20,
			"yCounts": 100,
			"zCounts": 30,
			"steps": 0,
			"heartRate": 0,
			"wearDetect": 1
		},
		{
			"timestamp": "07-07-2015 04:06:00",
			"xCounts": 10,
			"yCounts": 40,
			"zCounts": 200,
			"steps": 0,
			"heartRate": 0,
			"wearDetect": 1
		}]
	}
}

```

### Other JSON Responses
The following are other responses that can be received based off the various states of the SDK or if an error has occured.

#### Device found during scan
```json
{
	"device" : "TAS1A00000001"
}
```
#### Devices found after scan completed
```json
{
	"devices" : [
		"TAS1A14758923",
		"TAS1D03845638",
		"TAS1D83493233"
	]
}
```
#### Device Connected / Disconnected
```json
{
	"deviceConnected" : "TAS1A14758923"
}

{
	"deviceDisconnected" : "TAS1A14758923"
}
```
#### SDK Errors
```json
{
	"error" : {
		"code" : 3,
		"description" : "Unrecognized Configuration",
		"extra" : "inu, mageenetometer" 
	}
}
```
